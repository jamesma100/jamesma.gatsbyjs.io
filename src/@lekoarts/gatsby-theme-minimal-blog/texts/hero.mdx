  Hello there :)
</Text>

I'm a software engineer at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/about/), building tools and infrastructure for next-generation geospatial data. Originally from Taipei, I am now based in Seattle. I use he/him pronouns.

I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a degree in computer science. I'd like to think I have one specific area of focus, but the truth is my interests are pretty widespread, from systems to algorithm design to ML.

For fun I like running, bouldering, reading, cooking, and playing the piano. I'm not particularly good at any of these things.
