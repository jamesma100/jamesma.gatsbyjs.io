Local Hawaiian literature often communicate the place and history of Hawai’i in a way that is distinct from other, more mainstream literature. Namely, the ethnicity of the island people, the language they use, the history they share, their everyday lives, all of which is usually hidden behind the tourist gaze of hotels and beaches. One example of such literature is Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre by Lois-Ann Yamanaka, a collection of poems that differ from other APIDA literature in that setting and language play a much more prominent role, though they share many similar themes about life and society.

The use of creole and specific vocabulary has the effect of painting the Hawaiian identity as distinct from those of other Asian American communities on the mainland. Language can shape identity in many ways and is a part of how Asian American communities define themselves, distinct from other Asian American communities. In contrast, most Japanese American poems, such as Thirty Years Under by Mitsuye Yamada or Why Is Preparing Fish a Political Act by Janice Mirikitani, for example, use standard English. By using creole, Saturday Night helps represent native Hawaiian life in an authentic way and makes the statement that Hawai’i is different from other ethnic groups and has its unique identity.

Using Hawai’i as a setting helps bring attention to what is otherwise a very marginalized society. If there is one thing all Asian American literature share it is the opportunity to tell unheard stories of underrepresented populations. Similar to other APIDA pieces, such as Chinese American or Filipino American, Saturday Night is able to tell the world about the culture, traditions, and way of life of a certain group. Given that such an opportunity is rare, it is not unreasonable to expect such stories to be an accurate representation of the people they include and to change the world’s preconceived notions about them. Due to such an expectation, the use of certain stereotypes in Saturday Night, such as those regarding Filipino Americans, have elicited much criticism, and perhaps understandably so.

There are also many similarities between Hawaiian literature and other APIDA literature. For one, both can convey important themes about society. Saturday Night, for instance, has themes including familial conflicts, bullying among peers, maturing into adulthood, and love. The poem in the book with the same name details sexual violence and abuse of power. Such themes can be found in many other APIDA works as well, and it can be interesting to see how these themes intersect with different APIDA cultures and ethnicities.

Reading Hawaiian literature is an important step in understanding the culture and history of Hawaiian people. Hawaiian literature is quite unique in its use of language that most readers might not be familiar with, but it plays an important role in representing certain groups who are rarely seen or heard. The lack of exposure to local literature among the general population can result in harmful stereotypes, which is why APIDA literature is crucially important to shed light on unseen people.
